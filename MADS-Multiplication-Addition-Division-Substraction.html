                <p>Open the game. You will have the game mode such as ‘Addition’, ‘Subtraction’, ‘Multiplication’, ‘Division’ and ‘Mixed’. As the name suggests if you click on ‘Addition’ then you will be presented with only questions related to addition. Same for ‘Subtraction’, ‘Multiplication’ and ‘Division’. In ‘Mixed’ mode you will be presented with random questions related to random mode stored in ‘MADS’ <br>
<br>
	After you select a ‘Game Mode’ click start. You will see that the ‘Game Mode’ is ticked by default. Now you can choose the difficulty mode or choose ‘No Time Limit Mode’ if you choose any difficulty mode that is ‘Easy’, ‘Medium’ and ‘Hard’ then you will be given a certain time limit to answer the question depending on the difficulty level. If you can answer the question correctly you will get some points that will be added to 'Score' and the time limit will also increase according to the difficulty level. <br>
	<br>
	If you choose ‘No Time Limit Mode’ then your time limit is infinite. And you can select the range of numbers that will be presented to you as questions. Suppose you only want to add any numbers between 5- 20. Then select 5 as the lower limit and 20 as the higher limit. If you want to stop the game then press ‘End Game’ DO NOT click ‘X’ the close button. If you click ‘X’ the game will close but it won't store your score. Only click ‘X’ or close if you want to exit the game without saving the game. The ‘End Game’ button is also available on time limited game mode. Suppose you have huge amount of time in your ‘time limit’ but you don't want to play for that long then just click ‘End Game’ and if you have scored a new record then your score will be stored in the game.<br>
<br>
	You can change the background image on the game by clicking on Menu > Setting > Set Background Image. A picture of Mio Akiyama's image from K'on is set as default background image. To view all high score click on ‘Menu’ > ‘Show High Scores’
